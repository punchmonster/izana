<h2>You're a kid now you're a squid now</h2>

<p>As soon as I approached the research facility, I knew I wouldn't like what I would find. The whole thing was in shambles. Its doors were trellised in mutant plants, and its walls were crumbling and decrepit to the point that it was mostly a lost cause. Not only that, but almost all of the humans who had once inhabited it were either dead or transformed beyond repair by the mutated plants and animals which had overrun the place. Near the entrance, I found the lady who had pleaded for my help over the radio still somewhat alive. As I watched the plants tear her apart in horror, she scolded me--and she was right, as it was all my fault. What horrible acts did I commit, you may ask? Well, I saved a town.</p>

<p>This is the reality of the Wasteland. You will constantly run into tough moral dilemmas where, no matter what you do, seeing the results of your choice will make you feel you decided wrong. What would've happened if I had visited the facility before the town? Would these people still be alive? Would we have found the cure for these awful mutations? Since I chose to save Highpool--a town which controls the water supply for the local area--from being seized and destroyed by raiders, I might never know. Just like with the original Wasteland 25 years ago, this game sets itself apart largely due to the fact that almost every choice you make has a very real and lasting impact on the world around you, making everyone's experience truly unique in a way far more sincere than most games which claim to do the same..
Gameplay
This  game definitely isn't for everyone--pulling from its classic roots, the first thing Wasteland 2 does is throw numbers at you. The character creation can be overwhelming, with stats divided into four categories that are sometimes intertwined in nebulous and occasionally counterintuitive ways. This lack of clarity is doubly frustrating due to the fact that these statistical choices actually matter a great deal to the rest of your game. It’s very possible to get stuck ten, twenty, or thirty hours in due to one bad decision at the beginning. While this is annoying, it definitely corresponds with the game’s general style of consistently making the player feel like each dilemma is unwinnable, and no choice is correct. Immersive gameplay is great, don’t get me wrong--but when you’re creating a character you’ll have to use for seventy hours of gameplay, it can definitely feel like inXile took the concept a bit too far. Despite this holdup, the combat feels solid, and if you’ve played and enjoyed Fallout 1, 2, or Tactics, you will feel right at home in Wasteland 2’s turn-based system. The game also handles exploration, world-building and player-environment interaction really well. Even the most benign characters all have back-stories, and even the most useless-looking turtle will guide you to great secrets, provided you don’t rush and take the time to pay attention to your surroundings.
Conclusion
Wasteland 2 aims to be a worthy sequel to the critically acclaimed Wasteland, which was released over 25 years ago. Do I think Wasteland achieved that lofty goal? So far, since it seems that the game comprises an expansive and immersive environment, a convincing atmosphere, challenging and diverse combat, and a story in which the choices you make truly do matter, my first impression is that they have.

But hey, I'm only halfway through.</p>
